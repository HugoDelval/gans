Using GANS
----------

You will need 2 terminals :

One will interact with nmap. The other will parse and send to the first one the ip adresses that you will give it.

Here is the first one : (it needs root because it interacts with nmap)

> sudo ./gans run -d data.json

This deamon is now waiting for commands. It will read/write the infos it gathers/needs in the data.json file. (you can change this of course)

Here is how to specify which ip to scan, open a new terminal and in the same directory :

> ./gans scan \<range d'adresse IP\>

ex :

> ./gans scan 127.0.0.1/24

You can then parse the data generated by GANS :

> ./gans parse data.json
